## share in folders if POSSIBLE jupyter notebooks explaining your approaches!

Please codes with the next structure will make the help easier!: 

1. Folder with a **name**:

Inside :

  - **Code folder**: All the raw code in (python, R, c++, javascrypt, etc.) 
  - **Notebook**: Your comments and outputs for the data and problems! (optional but better so others can understand easier!) 
  - **Data folder**: Your databases, json files, pkl or other data format.
  - **README.md**: Category of the  problem + Explaining your problem! 


**(If you don't have jupyter COMMENT the much as you can your code!)**
